						description: "The \"Fischlehrpfad\" was my first project. I developed it in the 2nd year in my apprenticeship with a colleague. The project is a small website for a fishing club. It was developed with the CMS Grav.",

					},
					page: {
						textDescription: "The Fischlehrpfad was my first major project that I developed. In the second year of my apprenticeship, I planned and then developed the project for the fishing club on the Emme in Burgdorf with a colleague. The fishing club wanted to create a learning path about fish and other animal species in the Emme, where schools and families could learn about.",
						textContent: "The visitor can scan a QR code at a post and will be redirected to the respective page on the website. This page contains content such as text, images, videos, audios from which you can learn something about the Emme. But it also has interactive elements, such as a slider, a quiz and others, where you can then check what you have learned.",
						textProceed: "First we planned the project with a GANTT chart. We then created various mockups and selected a suitable design together with the customer. We then created a website with the CMS Grav in just under 6 months. At first, we had difficulties because the CMS was completely new to us, and we had to learn all the basics at the same time as the programming languages PHP and Twig.",
						textConclusion: "In the end, we were able to successfully complete the project and received a lot of positive feedback. In hindsight, it was quite stressful building a website with a tool you weren't familiar with, but we enjoyed it and learned or developed many skills.",

						tags: [ "web", "personal", "development" ],
					},
					page: {
						textDescription: "For a long time I wanted to have my own website, which I developed without a CMS. In this way I can also learn what interests me, and I am free to implement it as I wish. I started several times but always stopped because I ran out of time. In the end I was able to persuade myself and was motivated to create the website with the JavaScript library React.",
						textContent: "On my website I offer services to work and educate myself in my free time. In addition, I would like to earn money because I do not receive any wages during my apprenticeship. I also want to show my past projects I have made and show my experience.",
						textProceed: "Since I want to continue my education in the JavaScript/ TypeScript programming language, I started developing the website with React. I will often make improvements to this website as I always have new ideas.",
						textConclusion: "It's a lot of fun and I have a lot of motivation to work on this website. Mainly because I had a lot of time and effort to learn and use the technologies. I want to work on this project without a plan because it gives me the freedom to do whatever I want and less stress trying to stick to the plan as much as possible.",

					},
					page: {
						textDescription: "This website is the first website I developed for a private client. The customer is a club from my village that wants a new website. They want to present their club and share pictures of events.",
						textContent: "The website is kept simple so older members can navigate the site and find the content easily. The various pages contain content from events, pictures, rankings, etc. On a few pages there is also content about the club and how to become a member.",
						textProceed: "I developed this website with the CMS Grav. Through my work on the Fish Trail project, I was able to use the basic design and individual elements from the project, saving effort and time.",
						textConclusion: "It was a bit stressful as I was currently in my 2nd year and had to study for a lot of exams. But I think it's worth it because I now have more experience in project management and dealing with customers as well as the CMS Grav.",

						tags: [ "web", "client", "development" ],
					},
					page: {
						textDescription: "This website is for the Rumisberg Music Society, of which I have been a member for several years. Our old website was difficult to manage and change. For this reason, I should create a new website that is easy to manage.\n This project is under development.",
						textContent: "The website should list dates for our performances, and we would like to present our club. But there should also be a kind of blogging posts in which we want to share current events from the association publicly. This includes, for example, sharing successes and changes.",
						textProceed: "The website will be build with the CMS Grav because I already have a lot of experience with this CMS and also got good feedback from the users. The design has already been decided, and I am currently working on the content of the website.",
						textConclusion: "So far everything is going as planned, and I am happy to be able to contribute to my association as the youngest member as soon as the website is ready.",

						tags: [ "web", "personal", "development" ],
					},
					page: {
						textDescription: "Some time ago I saw the Magic Mirror project on the Internet. My mother then spent some money on a touch screen and a Raspberry Pi to run the software on. We hung the screen at the entrance to the apartment. But since many of the features we wanted to don't exist, I started to create such a dashboard myself.",
						textContent: "It should be a dashboard that displays the most important information. This includes time & date, weather and the most important dates. The digital shopping list should also be displayed. We also want to be able to control the lamps via this dashboard, which are already connected via the Google Home app. Further features are planned.",
						textProceed: "The dashboard runs with TypeScript and React. For the backend I use Next.js, which prepares data from various APIs and makes it available for the frontend. I take a lot of the design from the Magic Mirror.",
						textConclusion: "The dashboard isn't finished yet, but it's already working very well. Features like clock, weather and calendar are already implemented. The shopping list and the control of the lamps are still a work in progress.",
